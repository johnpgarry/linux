 * The extent swapping intent item help us perform atomic extent swaps between
 * two inode forks.  It does this by tracking the range of logical offsets that
 * still need to be swapped, and relogs as progress happens.
 *
 * *I items should be recorded in the *first* of a series of rolled
 * transactions, and the *D items should be recorded in the same transaction
 * that records the associated bmbt updates.
 *
 * Should the system crash after the commit of the first transaction but
 * before the commit of the final transaction in a series, log recovery will
 * use the redo information recorded by the intent items to replay the
 * rest of the extent swaps.
